# homework01
This homework uses two python files: ml_json_converter.py and ml_json_reader.py. Both files read in data from the NASA meteorite landings json file which shows charachteristics of all known meteorite landings. The charachteristics shown include the coordinate location of where the meteorite landed, its classification, the year it landed, its name, etc. The converter script writes the data into csv, xml, and yaml formats while the reader script prints a few summary statistics such as different classifications ......
