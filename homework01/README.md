# homework01
This homework uses two python files: ml_json_converter.py and ml_json_reader.py. Both files read in data from the NASA meteorite landings json file which shows charachteristics of all known meteorite landings. The charachteristics shown include the coordinate location of where the meteorite landed, its classification, the year it landed, its name, etc. The converter script writes the data into csv, xml, and yaml formats while the reader script manipulates the data and prints a few summary statistics such as the amount of each classifications of meteorites, the number of meteorites that landed in each hemisphere, the average mass of a meteorite, the smallest meteorite, and the largest meteorite. In order to run the scripts, the raw meteorite landings json data file must be downloaded. AI was used to learn how to convert the dictionaries to xml and yml formats because I was not able to fully understand the readthedocs.
